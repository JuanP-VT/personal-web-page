In the summer of 2014 a young man had to choose a path for his professional career, I always were a tech geek so naturally I was leaning
into software engineering or a related field but I also had huge desire to become like my older brother, I did not know much about the world
or even much about myself at that age so, partially blinded I went with my brother's advice to become a Industrial Engineer.
Although at some points I felt many topics were not very interesting my discipline kept me strong and boosted through my education.
By the end of 2018 I got my Bachelors Degree, flew to Tijuana(one of the biggest industrial cities in the country) and worked there for
nearly two years.
Despite doing fine I felt very unfulfilled by my professional life and  the overall environment of the manufacturing industry,
the next few months my life felt very gray, the choice that a unexperienced sprout took many years back, felt like chains that would
keep me bound to that situation.
But Im resilient and knew I had to do something about it..
