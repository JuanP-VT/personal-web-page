In the summer of 2014 a young man had to choose a path for his professional career, I always were a tech geek so naturally I was leaning
into software engineering or a related field but I also had huge desire to become like my older brother, I did not know much about the world
or even much about myself at that age so, partially blinded I went with my brother's advice to become a Industrial Engineer.
Although at some points I felt many topics were not very interesting my discipline kept me strong and boosted through my education.
By the end of 2018 I got my Bachelors Degree, flew to Tijuana(one of the biggest industrial cities in the country) and worked there for
nearly two years.
Despite doing fine I felt very unfulfilled by my professional life and  the overall environment of the manufacturing industry,
the next few months my life felt very gray, the choice that a unexperienced sprout took many years back, felt like chains that would
keep me bound to that situation.
But Im resilient and knew I had to do something about it..


During that time one of my closest friends lived a very similar situation, he was working as a plant maintenance engineer and felt very
unsatisfied, he later switched fields and became a software tester.
His new situation and work environment put him in a good mood so he tried to convince me to leave the manufacturing field and become a developer, but
at that time I wasn't ready to drop nearly 7 years of education and experience.
But the idea stood with me, I come from a  tech background, always were interested in videogames, technology, computers and even had some coding experience with C (school education) and
Lua(i used code in Minecraft's computercraft mod and I loved it), after a few months of research,talks and analysis it was clear, that idea became
a light ray that ignited my ambition for my professional life. It was settle i would become a Developer.
