# CV Creator App

## What is this ?

This project is part of my **Curriculum Series**, the objective is to have a repository to prove my skills as a web developer.

This is my presentation to the professional world, as someone who comes from a different work field I want to prove my competence, potential and skills as a developer.

I created this so recruiters can get a better view of myself.

## Features:

- Mobile support (320px minimum screen wide)
- Default night / light modes
- Multi language(En/Es)
- Video demo of my highlight projects
- Links to all my contact info

## Objective

- Summarize my skills and competences in a webpage
- Utilize a wide range of web developer skills (not just a boring page)
- Create the page from complete scratch with CRA
